      <description>Search algorithms help find the correct sequence of actions in a search space, to reach a goal state. The sequence of actions might be:
 Sequence in which citis are to be visited to travel from a source to a detination under a given cost function (shortest path, cheapest fare etc.) Sequence in which an agent should play moves in a game (chess, tic tac toe, pacman etc.) to win a board game Sequence in which a robot arm should solder components on a PCB under a given cost function (e.</description>

I am on a journey to explore these topics. I find them fascinating. I take notes as I read, listen, learn. These blog posts are extensions of my notes. These are mostly for me to read later. You may find them helpful as well.
