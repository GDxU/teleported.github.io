      <description>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</description>

      <description>(I wrote this piece as part of an assignment for Udacity&amp;rsquo;s AI Nanodegree program)
&amp;lsquo;Go&amp;rsquo; is typically an adversarial search problem where the objective is to find the best move for the AI Agent to defeat it&amp;rsquo;s opponent, given a board position. Go is a two player, deterministic game of perfect information.
Two main factors make Go very complex to solve:
 Go has an average branching factor b of ~250 options per node (chess ~35) Go has an average depth d of ~150 moves (chess ~80)  These factos make the state space of Go (bd) enormous to search end to end.</description>

      <description>Search algorithms help find the correct sequence of actions in a search space, to reach a goal state. The sequence of actions might be:
 Sequence in which cities are to be visited to travel from a source to a destination under a given cost function (shortest path, cheapest fare etc.) Sequence in which an agent should play moves in a game (chess, tic tac toe, pacman etc.) to win a board game Sequence in which a robot arm should solder components on a PCB under a given cost function (e.</description>

      <description>I mostly blog about intuition and concepts in AI and Machine Learning and subjects associated with them (statistics, programming etc.).
I am on a journey to explore these topics. I find them fascinating. I take notes as I read, listen, learn. These blog posts are extensions of my notes. These are mostly for me to read later. You may find them helpful as well.
